        Setup Already Run
        </b></p>

        <p>
        It appears setup has already been run. To re-run
        setup, you need to stop your appserver, delete the "chat-settings.xml" file from the WEB-INF directory,
        and restart your appserver. You will then be able to reload the setup tool.
